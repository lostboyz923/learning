[ E 2024-06-05 08:00:49.7642 31087/T5 age/Cor/SecurityUpdateChecker.h:521 ]: A security update is available for your version (6.0.10) of Phusion Passenger(R). We strongly recommend upgrading to version 6.0.22.
[ E 2024-06-05 08:00:49.7643 31087/T5 age/Cor/SecurityUpdateChecker.h:526 ]: Additional security update check information: 
- [Fixed in 6.0.14] [CVE-2018-25032] zlib before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.
- [Fixed in 6.0.14] A use after free memory safety issue was introduced in 6.0.12, and fixed in 6.0.14.
- [Fixed in 6.0.19] [CVE-2023-38545] A vulnerability existed in libcurl before 8.4.0 which was the library used for Passenger proxy functionality. Exploiting this vulnerability would require two preconditions. First a SOCKS5 proxy to be configured for Passenger licensing, anonymous telemetry, or security update check which is not the default but is possible. Second the attacker would need to cause Passenger to use an attacker-controlled URL when performing these requests. Causing Passenger to use non-standard urls requires that the attacker already have code execution on the Passenger host, or control of the Passenger config. If exploited this vulnerability could lead to code execution, due to buffer overflow.
