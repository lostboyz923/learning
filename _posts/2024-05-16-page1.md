!



So this is my first post.  We can now start practicing with jekyll and out writing skills. 
So tomorrow we shall start writing our first post. We will begin this schedule of writing in the mornings one blog poast per day. We must strengthen our writing skills. There are 2 types of people. Those who can write and those who can not. As well as there are those who can weld and those who can not. I wish to learn how to write in jekyll as well as in markdown.  I know markdown farily well but I wish to learn how to write in jekyll. I also wish to learn how to write better like my friend Abigail.  One of the best writers i know. Sure we won't be as good as she is, but we can learn better comma placement as well as better NGP techniques and more.
Knowing how to write a good story that is able to grab the reader and place them in another place of their own mind is something we wish to master. The power of writing is something that has always been a part of my life.
